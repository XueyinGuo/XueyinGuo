- 👋 Hi, I’m @XueyinGuo
- 👀 I’m interested in Java & Deep Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently reading Tomcat source code and trying to build a RPC FrameWork base on Netty.
- 🌱 And my plan of source code reading include Spring/SpringMVC/Tomcat/SpringBoot/MyBatis/Netty, **SpringBoot and MyBatis haven't start yet**.
- 🌱 **Spring** was finished on 2021-01-25. Welcome to pull.
- 🌱 **Netty** was finished on 2021-03-17. Welcome to pull.
- 🌱 **Tomcat** Source Code Reading And Its Architecture Learning Has Been Started on 2021-5-14.
- 🌱 **SpringMVC** Source Code Reading And Its Architecture Learning Has Been Started on 2021-6-11.
- 🌱 And I have been started to try to build a RPC based on Netty on 2021-5-20, cuz I realy want to kown what the hell will happen when we send a request to the server if this       server use Netty instead of Tomcat. And why the architecture between Tomcat And Netty are so different. The answer is you can build a server without Servlet Container when you decode + encode the request + response by yourserlf.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now.
